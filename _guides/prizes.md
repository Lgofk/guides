## Overview

## Top Scanner

**50m ISK** awarded at the end of each month to the All-Out member at **#1 on the Vippy leaderboard**.

You can check your position by hovering the `Statistics` tab and clicking on `Leaderboard`.  Tip: your score will increase faster if you paste all the sigs in every wormhole you enter (regardless of if the sigs have been scanned down or not) and paste all of them again each time you make an amount of progress while scanning a signature.

## Content Creators

**All PVP loot** (or its market value if desired) will be awarded to the scout who was responsible for finding it.

This means the person who

- found the wormhole they live in and realized they had ships out
- checked dscan more often and saw the ship first
- realized that gas anom there has a gas miner in it
- jumped into the new hole and found the ship sitting on it
- saw the suspect in local
- found the twitch stream
- etc

If there is a dispute about who the loot goes to (multiple people seeing something simultaneously, a gate camp, etc, etc) please use common sense and figure it out yourselves like adults.

*B-But FC, that means the guy in the interceptor taking the gates in our roam is getting all the money while the people in vexors get nothing!*

Yes. Next time, volunteer to fly as the scout.

*But I'm slow at dscanning and am not so good at finding good targets.  If I scout, the roam might be boring and people won't want me to scout!*

Everything you just said is why scouting isn't easy and the people who work to be good at it should be rewarded.  Don't worry, we'll give you chances to learn - practice makes perfect!

## Forward Tacklers

**SRP** will be available to the pilot(s) responsible for light/initial tackle.

Does not apply to heavy/secondary tackle.  In wormholes, we recommend you use cloaky ships (usually bombers, to avoid targetting delay); in k-space cloakies, interceptors, or fast frigs are most common.

*[SRP]: Ship Replacement Policy
*[k-space]: all systems that are not wormholes
