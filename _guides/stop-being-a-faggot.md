## FC I want content

I learned the hard way because most people in All-Out aren't exactly go-doers. The entire reason why I have my second account is because I dual-boxed logi and FC'd the PVE Operations while we lived in Pandora and it forced me to learn literally everything in Eve to make sure no one dies (protip: no one died, no one got dropped, and we made dank dollars whenever I FC'd a PVE Fleet)

Chances are you're poor as fuck, have low skills (piloting and SP), and a positive sec status.

Go through the same loop I did. Do elite solo PVP in frigates to get a feel of how to handle 1v1 frigate duels on your own. It gives you knowledge of not only what your ship can go up against, but how other ships are flown or how you can use elite keep-at-range from blaster boats while they're dual webbed.

Starting off with frigates and destroyers will force you to lose the blob mentality and learn about taking fights that are in your favor. Blob mentality is that you won't lose anyone if you have superior numbers. In solo, you need to use speed, agility, tacs, and other things to force the faster frigates to burn from their gang of spooky cruisers so you can kill the fragile frigates while gtfoing once everything else comes on top of you.

I'd suggest against using [T3D](http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Category:Tactical_Destroyers)s mainly because their cost effectiveness is rapidly dropping and it'll make people more likely to engage you in shit that won't completely obliterate you.

## FC I was alpha'd in a frigate by some faggot

Frigates are squishy as fuck and its best if you learn to make the most out of you small HP pool, sig, and speed. (Also that you don't engage a [Dramiel](http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Dramiel) who can project his damage harder than your scram kite [Executioner](http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Executioner).) 90% of EVE is countering your opponent, which is done using information you get before engaging (both from the seconds before you warp in and from the years you've played). The last 10% is actual piloting to make sure a brawler doesn't get within your range or getting onto a squishy Imperial Navy Slicer.

## FC I'm heading to lowsec

Lowsec outside of Faction Warfare is pretty damn quiet. You can make a lot of money heading to the dead-end systems of [Khanid](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Khanid) or [Aridia](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Aridia) .1 systems and farming Clone Soldiers, Mordu Rats, or even do hubs in a 100MN [Vexor](http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Vexor). But we're not here to be PVE carebears right now, unless you happen to find the 90 fucking JohnnyPew stratios in [Aridia](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Aridia).

Meatgrinding frigates in Faction Warfare Lowsec is the easiest place to find 1v1 frigate duels because people are plexing and it's easy money/fights. Finding content comes in two ways:

### Camping

Camping a [faction warfare plex](http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Factional_Warfare#Complexes) gives you pre-fight range dictation by sitting next to the warp-in beacon at your preferred optimal range. Done right, you can kill most people unless you're blobbed or a [Griffin](http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Griffin) tackles you.

### Hunting

Surprisingly enough, there are actually [Venture](http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Venture)s and other miners inside lowsec. Roaming around you can find people belt-ratting clone soldiers or other people inside plexes. Warp to a scan spot, dscan the entire area, and then slowly reduce and pinpoint your scan towards preferred targets. Get this into habit and it'll help a lot when hunting down people anywhere in space.

Everything boils down to one thing: Use what information is given to you and autism harder to figure out what to do. [zKill](https://zkillboard.com/) local to find out some fag uses LML AB [Kestrels](http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Kestrel) and then hunt it inside the novice plex. Use an MWD to trump the AB meta and separate people on-grid inside the plex. Watchlist the local faggots who use links, get a feel for what groups control what system so you know when backup will come.

## FC I'm heading to nullsec

I've added my usual roaming spots into the MOTD of corp chat ingame. You should give those places a try sometime since they're directly connected into Empire space. Space Monkey's Alliance are actually retarded monkeys and there's a nice loop you can roam through before the camp gets to you. [Providence](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Providence) is Tibical but they'll escalate hard if you're an established local. [Queerious](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Querious) is now the new hotspot and much closer to Amarr for instant frags.

We're still a wormhole corp, and you can easily run around scanning chains and finding paths into nullsec. Alternatively if you want to hit the further regions of nullsec where they're not acquainted to PVP roamers, consider using [Thera](http://www.eve-scout.com/) to hit those regions without burning an hour and then getting blobbed.

Nullsec is primarily filled with shitters and nearly everyone and their mother uses an MWD. Speed allows you to separate the tackle from the DPS and you can feast on the interceptors and sabres before the spooky vexor gang gets to you.

The best thing you can do in nullsec is create a wide range of tactical bookmarks on gates, stations, and other important places where people might head through / receive constant fights. Having the ability to dictate pre-fight range by burning and warping to other spots on grid will support you in picking select targets off.

## FC I don't know how to hunt

This applies to wormholes as well. Upon entering system do a full range dscan. Figure out what ships are on scan and then quickly reduce the AU scan to nearby planets / celestial / anomalies to pinpoint where they are. People are carebears and you only have a very small window to actually find out where they are, initiate warp, and hope you can tackle them. Wormholes have a different hunting strategy. You enter hole, cloak the fuck up, and slowly scan for activity.

What you're looking for is all the same. Active duders from wrecks on scan, drones, and a fuckton of anomalies. In faction warfare space, look for fags in plexes that are active (Already on Overview). In nullsec, look for mining fags in anoms or ratters inside Forsaken Hubs. In wormholes, look for a drake that isn't bait.

## FC I'm still retarded

Joining fleets where I'm babysitting or scouting isn't going to make your personal skill any better. We're a small corp stuck inside wormholes. You have access to the money, but it's up to someone to create the content. Host a fleet, go hunting out of a nullsec wormhole, stockpile ships inside Thera and fit up hyperspatial thrashers to grind sweep areas for targets.

## TL;DR

A LOT OF EVE IS ACTUALLY PRETTY FUCKIN' DEAD. HEAD TO PLACES WITH PEOPLE, KILL SAID PEOPLE, SPEND 50 JUMPS BEING BLUEBALLED AND GO FANGS OUT ON THE NEAREST SHITHEAD WHO DECIDES TO AGRESS YOU ON A GATE
