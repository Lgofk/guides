## Introduction

Gas huffing in wormhole space is a lucrative activity that pilots of all SP levels can profit from.  then you can train the bare minimum huffing skills in 21 hours.

## Skills

If you made your character after September 29th, 2015 (when starting SP was buffed to from 50k to 400k), then you already have `Mining Frigate I` and `Mining III` trained.  Time estimates below are made assuming this is the case for you, and you are on the default 20/20/19/20/20 remap and have no implants.

### Minimum Skills

21 hours to train from scratch.  You should take some time to train this just so you don't get left out if we find one of the super valuable clouds and run a fleet for it.


- `Gas Cloud Harvesting I` (8m, 20s) (24m ISK for skillbook)
    - `Mining IV` (20h, 41m, 49s)

### Reasonable Skills

7 days, 3 hours to train from scratch.  This should be your norm if you intend to make any regular money off ninja huffing before you have the combat SP to be able to clear sites (`Gas Cloud Harvester II` huffs twice as fast `Gas Cloud Harvester I`, so your profit doubles).

- `Mining Frigate III` (8h, 36m, 40s)
- `Gas Cloud Harvesting V` (5d, 22h, 13m, 20s) (24m ISK for skillbook)
    - `Mining IV` (20h, 41m, 49s)

### Advanced Skills

18 days, 15 hours to train from scratch.  Your huffing rate increases by 5% per level of `Mining Frigate`, but most wormholers don't want to spend that kind of time training a mining ship.

- `Mining Frigate V` (11d, 20h, 10m)
- `Gas Cloud Harvesting V` (5d, 22h, 13m, 20s) (24m ISK for skillbook)
    - `Mining IV` (20h, 41m, 49s)

If you actually train this far, you might as well go all the way and train up a [Prospect](http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Prospect) while you're at it (about 30 days from scratch).  This doesn't make you huff any faster than a Venture, but it doubles your available cargo capacity and allows you to memehuff certain sites without clearing rats by sigtanking with its sig reduction bonus.
