## Introduction

Gas huffing in wormhole space can make you some decent money with a reasonable skillpoint and isk investment.  The main skillbook costs 24m ISK and it takes about a week to train the skills to 90% of maximum efficiency.

## Overview

## Skills

If you made your character after September 29th, 2015 (when starting SP was buffed to from 50k to 400k), then you already have `Mining Frigate I` and `Mining III` trained.  Time estimates below are made assuming this is the case for you, and you are on the default 20/20/19/20/20 remap and have no implants.

### Minimum Skills

21 hours to train from scratch.  You should take some time to train this just so you don't get left out if we find one of the super valuable clouds and run a fleet for it.


- `Gas Cloud Harvesting I` (8m, 20s) (24m ISK for skillbook)
    - `Mining IV` (20h, 41m, 49s)

### Normal Skills

7 days, 3 hours to train from scratch.  This should be your norm if you intend to make any regular money off ninja huffing before you have the combat SP to be able to clear sites (`Gas Cloud Harvester II` huffs twice as fast `Gas Cloud Harvester I`, so your profit per time spent doubles).

- `Mining Frigate III` (8h, 36m, 40s)
- `Gas Cloud Harvesting V` (5d, 22h, 13m, 20s) (24m ISK for skillbook)
    - `Mining IV` (20h, 41m, 49s)

### Advanced Skills

18 days, 15 hours to train from scratch.  Your huffing rate increases by 5% per level of `Mining Frigate`, but most wormholers don't want to spend that kind of time training a mining ship.

- `Mining Frigate V` (11d, 20h, 10m)
- `Gas Cloud Harvesting V` (5d, 22h, 13m, 20s) (24m ISK for skillbook)
    - `Mining IV` (20h, 41m, 49s)

If you actually train this far, you might as well go all the way and train up a [Prospect](http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Prospect) while you're at it (about 30 days from scratch).  This doesn't make you huff any faster than a Venture, but it doubles your available cargo capacity and allows you to memehuff certain sites without clearing rats by sigtanking with its sig reduction bonus.

## Fitting Your Huffing Ship

You will use a [Venture](http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Venture), or if you want to train for a month for a small improvement and a lot more ISK on the field, a [Prospect](http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Prospect).  These are the only ships with role bonuses to gas harvesting.  Two harvesters fit to these ships have the yield of four harvesters fit to any other ship.

### Example Fit

[Venture, Gas Huffer]

Nanofiber Internal Structure II

5MN Cold-Gas Enduring Microwarpdrive
Scan Rangefinding Array I
Scan Rangefinding Array I

Core Probe Launcher I
Gas Cloud Harvester II
Gas Cloud Harvester II

Small Gravity Capacitor Upgrade I

[Empty Rig slot]

Hornet EC-300 x2

Core Scanner Probe I x8

### Essential Modules

- 2x `Gas Cloud Harvester I` or `Gas Cloud Harvester II`.  The T2 version makes you money twice as fast.
- 1x `5MN Cold-Gas Enduring Microwarpdrive`, `5MN Quad LiF Restrained Microwarpdrive`, or `5MN Y-T8 Compact Microwarpdrive`.  When ninja-huffing, you *need* an MWD to travel between the gas clouds; an AB is too slow.  And while you are huffing, it is a lot harder for a cloaky hostile to catch you if you are orbiting the cloud with your MWD active.

### Optional Modules

#### High Slots

You have space to pick one of the following:

- 1x `Core Probe Launcher I` and 8x `Core Scanner Probe I`.  A mantra of wormhole space is to have a launcher and probes with you at all times.  This is my preferred choice.  However, if you choose these and then bad boys show up to your huffing op, you will have to bounce from bookmark to bookmark until they get bored or you will get combat probed and killed.  
- 1x `Basic Cloaking Device I` or `Improved Cloaking Device II`.  This allows you to run to your safe spot, cloak up, and wait indefinitely for any bad boys to go away before you try to escape or keep huffing.  However, you have no probes - if you are forced to sit cloaked long enough your exit will close, you will be trapped, and you will need to self destruct and lose your cargo to get out anyway.

#### Mid Slots

You have slots to pick two of the following, but you may not have enough fitting space for some combinations:

- `Medium Shield Extender` or variant.  Gives you buffer to survive a volley (from players or sleepers) on your way out of the site
- `Adaptive Invulnerability Field` or variant, or other damage-specific shield hardener.
- `Prototype ECCM Magnetometric Sensor Cluster`. Makes you harder to combat probe.
- Any of the scanning upgrades: `Scan Acquisition Array`, `Scan Rangefinding Array`, `Scan Pinpointing Arragy`.  These will make it less soul-crushing to probe in a venture.

#### Low Slots

You have one low slot:

- `Warp Core Stabilizer`.  This means a hostile has to have 4 points of warp disruption to pin you down.  T1 is cheap, T2 lets you lock faster and farther (important to consider when under the time constraints of ninja huffing).
- `Damage Control`. Gives you more EHP if you're slow getting out of the site.
- `Nanofiber Internal Structure II` makes you burn faster inside the site and align faster to get out of the site.
- `Inertial Stabilizer II` makes you align even faster, but makes your sig bigger (faster to get locked and easier to get hit).
