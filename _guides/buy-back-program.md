## Introduction

Hi, my name is [Killar Monk](http://evewho.com/pilot/Killar+Monk) and I will buy stuff from [White Stag Exit Bag](http://evewho.com/alli/White+Stag+Exit+Bag) members (and affiliates) in Joruzesalem at **Jita buy price**, saving you the trouble of shipping cargo down the chain out yourself.

## Overview

## How to Sell Me Stuff

1. Dock in the **Nakkisuoja** citadel in Joruzesalem.
1. Make sure the items you want to sell are in your **Item Hangar**
1. Select all the items you want to sell
1. Right click on the selected items
1. In the context menu, click `Deliver To`
1. In the delivery window, search for **Killar Monk**
1. Highlight **Killar Monk** in the list of results
1. Click the `Deliver Items` button at the bottom of the delivery window

I will receive an evemail with a list of all the items you've delivered to me.  I will use Evepraisal on this list to establish the Jita buy price, and send you that amount.

## Things I Buy

- Sleeper loot ("blue loot")
- Relic and data loot (from both pirate and sleeper sites)
- All kinds of salvage (normal ships and sleeper ships)
- Ship modules (pvp loot, ratting loot, manufactured goods)
- Wormhole gas
- Ore / compressed ore / minerals

Basically, if you have something in the wormhole that you want turn into cash, I'll probably buy it.

## Notes

### I can haul under wardec

I have an out-of-corp DST pilot, so I am able to keep services going even when the alliance is wardecced and regular travel to trade hubs is restricted.

### I don't do loot splits

I will pay the full value of the items to the person who delivered it to me.  If the items represent a group effort, the group needs to figure out the split themselves.

### Payments are not instant

Depending on what k-space connections we get get in our chain and what kind of cash flow I have, it may take a few days to get payments made.  Don't worry, I'm working on it and haven't forgotten you.
