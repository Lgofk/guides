## Introduction

Hi, my name is [Mussah Yacoub](http://evewho.com/pilot/Mussah+Yacoub) and I will buy stuff from All-Out members in our home hole at **92% of its current Jita sell price**, saving you the trouble of shipping it out yourself and managing sell orders for it.  (That's a working percent, I'll try it for a while and see how it goes.)

## Overview

* TOC

## What Kind Of Stuff Can I Sell?

- Relic and data loot (from both pirate and sleeper sites)
- Sleeper loot ("blue loot")
- All kinds of salvage (normal ships and sleeper ships)
- Ship modules (pvp loot, ratting loot, manufactured goods)
- Wormhole gas
- Ore / compressed ore / minerals

## How Do I Sell Stuff?

1. I have to be online and in the hole (because there are no contracts in wormholes).
1. Drop your stuff in an empty **Buy-Back can**.  There are two, anchored above and below the staging tower, and they are bookmarked in the folder `Corporation Locations > Buy-Back` so you can warp to them.  Each can holds 3,900 m3.
1. Ping me in Slack/Teamspeak/in-game and let me know:
    - Which can(s) contain your stuff
    - Who needs to be paid for it (I can split the payouts for groups of people)
1. I will take a Jita evepraisal of the can(s), record it in my spreadsheet, pay the people involved, and empty the can.

## My Stuff Won't Fit the Cans

Uh.  Talk to me. I'm sure we can find an empty division somewhere in the staging tower to transfer with.
