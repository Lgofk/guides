## Introduction

Hi, my name is [Mussah Yacoub](http://evewho.com/pilot/Mussah+Yacoub) and I will buy stuff from All-Out members in our home hole at **average of Jita buy/sell**, saving you the trouble of shipping it out yourself and managing sell orders for it.  (That's a working percent, I'll try it for a while and see how it goes.)

## Overview

## Things I'm Buying

- Relic and data loot (from both pirate and sleeper sites)
- Sleeper loot ("blue loot")
- All kinds of salvage (normal ships and sleeper ships)
- Ship modules (pvp loot, ratting loot, manufactured goods)
- Wormhole gas
- Ore / compressed ore / minerals

### Text Steps:

1. Go to the staging tower. 
1. Get **Small Standard Container**(s) from the CHA, Division 1 and put them in your ship's cargo.  You'll need 100m3 free space per can.
1. "Launch for Self" and then "Scoop to Cargo" the cans in order to unpackage them if they're packaged
1. Rename the cans with the names of the people who need payment for the loot
1. Put your loot in the cans (each one holds 120m3)
1. Drop the cans into the CHA, Division 7
1. I'll check Div 7 for cans periodically, clear it out, pay people and put the empty cans back into Div 1.

## Your Stuff Won't Fit the Cans

Talk to me. We can find somewhere with enough space to transfer.

## Concerning Selling to Grm

You can if you want.  We are offering the same price, and it's simpler for Grm to periodically buy out my stockpile of sleeper material than to organize transactions with each of you individually.  I'm also buying more things than the sleeper salvage and gas he's interested in.
