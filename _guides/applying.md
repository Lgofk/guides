## The "Interview"

### The Relaxed Way

**Do this if:** You're already playing regularly and are interested in checking out All-Out culture to see if it's a fit for you.  You don't mind spending a couple of days to a couple of weeks before deciding if you want to apply and you're having fun where you are.

- Join the in game chat channel `DoomedFromTheStart`.  Have it open while you're logged in and playing.  Say hello and that you're interested in checking out the corp.  Chill and chitchat with our members and friends.  (You might also be interested in joining `/v/ bros` to see All-Out members as a part of a larger community, but keep in mind that we are simply one group among many there.)

- You need to eventually talk to one of the directors.  [Mussah Yacoub](http://evewho.com/pilot/Mussah+Yacoub) and [Nootkin](http://evewho.com/pilot/Nootkin) are usually online during USTZ and [Syco Phantic](http://evewho.com/pilot/Syco+Phantic) is usually online during EUTZ.  We log in pretty much daily, so you'll see us around.  (The AUTZ director position is open; we can provide competitive rates of `Exotic Dancers, Male` for qualified applicants.)

### The Speedy Way

**Do this if:** You're just returning to the game (or starting the game) and want to jump right in with a corp to start doing things immediately.  You already have an idea of who All-Out are and what we do from hearing through friends or from [the thread](orph.link/eog), and you want in.

- Send a mail to one of the directors

## The Application

Submit an application to the corp in-game.  You need to include:

- A full API key, making sure to include
    - the key
    - the verification code

- An email address
    - used to invite you to the All-Out Slack server (the [Slack Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slack_(software)#Features))
    - visible to all members of the server, so don't use your private email
    - doesn't need to be checked frequently
