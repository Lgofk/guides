## The "Interview"

### The Relaxed Way

**Do this if:** You're already playing regularly and are interested in checking out All-Out culture to see if it's a fit for you.  You don't mind spending anywhere from a couple of days to a couple of weeks before deciding if you want to apply and you're still having fun wherever you are.

- Join the in game chat channel `DoomedFromTheStart` (<button type="button" onclick="CCPEVE.joinChannel('DoomedFromTheStart')">ingame browser link</button>).  Have it open while you're logged in and playing.  Say hello and that you're interested in checking out the corp.  Chill and chitchat with our members and friends.  (You might also be interested in joining `/v/ bros` (<button type="button" onclick="CCPEVE.joinChannel('/v/ bros')">ingame browser link</button>) to see All-Out members as a part of a larger community, but keep in mind that we are simply one group among many there.)

- You need to eventually talk to one of the directors.  [Mussah Yacoub](http://evewho.com/pilot/Mussah+Yacoub) and [Nootkin](http://evewho.com/pilot/Nootkin) are usually online during USTZ and [Syco Phantic](http://evewho.com/pilot/Syco+Phantic) is usually online during EUTZ.  We log in pretty much daily, so you'll see us around.  (The AUTZ director position is open; we provide competitive rates payable in `Exotic Dancers, Male` for qualified applicants.)

### The Speedy Way

**Do this if:** You're just returning to the game (or starting the game) and want to jump right in with a corp to start doing things immediately.  You already have an idea of who All-Out are and what we do from hearing through friends or from [the thread](orph.link/eog), and you want in.

Send a mail to one of the directors.  Hit these points, plus any other info you think is relevant:

- What have you been doing in Eve till now?
- What are you excited about doing in Eve?  What kind of goals do you have?
- How did you hear about All-Out?  What have you heard about us already?
- (If applicable) How do you feel about the corp you just left / would be leaving? Why are you leaving?
- Are you USTZ, EUTZ, or AUTZ?  (Or are you a special snowflake of some kind?)
- Who is you're waifu?

## The Application

You can submit your application to the corp in-game at any time.  You need to include:

### Full API key

As members of a wormhole corp, All-Out pilots live in a POS and have significant access to each otherâ€™s ships and assets.  We also recruit a lot of our pilots from 4chan (keeping things interesting, but not particularly safe) and have no minimum requirements for joining (making us vulnerable to day-one spy alts).  Requiring a full API for every account members bring into the corp helps us keep your assets more secure.

Use this link to make your key [http://community.eveonline.com/support/api-key/CreatePredefined?accessMask=1073741823](http://community.eveonline.com/support/api-key/CreatePredefined?accessMask=1073741823) and set your fields like this:

- Name - `All-Out`
- Character - `All`
- Type - `Character`
- Expires - `No Expiry`

In the body of your application you need to include the **key** (a short number) and the **verification code** (a long string of numbers and letters)

### Email Address

This is used to invite you to the All-Out Slack server.  Slack is a web chat system based on the XMPP protocol that Jabber, etc use.  Unlike IRC it saves history, so when you log in you can scroll back and get up-to-date on what you've missed.  Most of All-Out's organization and corp discussion happens here.

Note: this email address will be visible to all members of the server, so it might be unwise to use a "real life" email.  You don't need to check this address frequently
