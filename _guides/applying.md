## The Application

### General Questions

This section can be waived at a [director](http://all-out.github.io/guides/people/#directors)'s discretion.  If one of them tells you that you don't need to answer these, please **say so in your application** and **include the director's name**.

- What have you been doing in Eve till now?
- What are you excited about doing in Eve?  What kind of goals do you have?
- How did you hear about All-Out?
- What have you heard about All-Out already?
- (If applicable) How do you feel about the corp you would be leaving? Why are you leaving them?
- (If applicable) Is there a current or past member of All-Out who can vouch for you or who recommended us to you?
- Are you USTZ, EUTZ, or AUTZ?  (Or are you a special snowflake of some kind?)
- Who is you are waifu?

Feel free to include any additional information that you think is relevant.

### Full API key

This section is **required**; applications omitting it will be rejected and you will need to reapply.

Use this link to make your API key [http://community.eveonline.com/support/api-key/CreatePredefined?accessMask=1073741823](http://community.eveonline.com/support/api-key/CreatePredefined?accessMask=1073741823) and set your fields as follows:

- Name - `All-Out`
- Character - `All`
- Type - `Character`
- Expires - `No Expiry`

In the body of your application you need to include the **key** (a short number) and the **verification code** (a long string of numbers and letters).  You do not need to include the acess mask.

#### Why does All-Out require a full API?

Like all wormhole corps, All-Out pilots live in a POS and have significant access to each otherâ€™s ships and assets.  We also recruit a lot of our pilots from 4chan (keeping things interesting, but not particularly safe) and have no minimum requirements for joining (making us vulnerable to day-one spy alts).  Requiring a full API from every account in the corp helps us keep your assets more secure.

### Email Address

This section is **required**; applications omitting it will be rejected and you will need to reapply.

Your **email address** is used to send you an invitation email for the All-Out Slack server.  Slack is a web chat frontend for the XMPP protocol that Jabber, etc use.  Unlike IRC it saves history, so when you log in you can scroll back and get up-to-date on what you've missed.  A lot of All-Out's organization, fleet pings, corp discussion, etc happens here - not in corp chat.

Note: your email address will be visible to all members of the server, so it might be unwise to use a "real life" email.  You don't need to check this address frequently


## General Application Tips

- Avoid one-word answers to the application questions (no need to write a novel, though).
- Join the in-game chat channel <button class="btn btn-primary btn-xs" type="button" title="Click button in in-game browser to join channel" onclick="CCPEVE.joinChannel('DoomedFromTheStart')">DoomedFromTheStart</button>.  Have it open while you're logged in and playing.  Say hello and that you're interested in checking out the corp.  Chill and chitchat with our members and friends.
- I (Mussah) am a lazy fart and applications take while to check, so displaying demonstrated interest is a plus.  Your app will probably get processed faster if you mention your impatience to a director in the pub channel from time to time.

## Why Hasn't My Application Been Accepted?

### Did you include a full API key and email address?

No? That's why.

Yes?  Keep reading.

### Are there any recruitment restrictions in the `DoomedFromTheStart` MOTD?

Yes?  Depending on the situation, the corp might be on lockdown and acceptances are being delayed for security reasons.  Feel free to ask for clarification in the pub channel; if it's not >super opsec< we'll let you know what's up.  When the restrictions are lifted, your app will be processed normally (or we'll mail you with specifics).

No? Keep reading.

### Ask a director personally.

If you've included all the information we need and there are no current restrictions and you've talked to us but your application still hasn't been accepted, don't be afraid to mail a director and ask what's up.  Mostly likely we're just busy and haven't gotten around to it and a mail will remind us.  Or there might be some red flags on your app that we need more time to look at or ask you about.  It could be a lot of things; doesn't hurt at all to ask.
