## Basic Information

To live in an All-Out POS, you must pay rent.

Rent amount is calculated as **All-Out Operating Expenses** / **Number of Members Living in All-Out POS** and sent out as a corp mail around the first of each month.

Renters have until the end of that month to pay the specified amount.

Assets belonging to members who go inactive or miss payments will be moved out to high sec for retrieval at their leisure.

## Operating Expenses

| Name          | Cost/Month |
|---------------|------------|
| Tower 1 fuel  | 400m       |
| Tower 2 fuel  | 400m       |
| Vippy         | 300m       |
| Miscellaneous | 200m       |

This comes to a total operating cost of 1.3b a month.

Miscellaneous expenses include but are not limited to:

- Subsidizing hole-rolling ships
- Subsidizing home-defense ships
- Subsidizing cheap roaming ships

## Considered and Discarded Alternatives

- Taxing home sleeper sites (or giving all home sites to corp).
  - Pros:
    - Line members don't have to think about anything, just run the sites, turn in the loot, and get paid (maybe).  It's on the directorship to figure the finances out.
  - Cons:
    - Most corps that do this live in high class holes and home site are a huge source of income.  We live in a C2 and our sites aren't worth much.
    - People who can clear our C3 statics hardly consider our home sites worth running at all, much less if they only get part/none of the profits.  Betting the corp on people running home sites out of altruism is bad business sense, and depending on lower-skilled members who are running C2s because they can't run harder sites makes no sense when we have higher skilled pilots getting a free ride.
- Taxing all sleeper sites run by corp members.
  - Pros:
    - Potentially a significant source of income when members make rich wormhole finds or as they get better at running high-class sites.
    - Scales up with activity levels (in high activity times, the corp gets rich).
  - Cons:
    - Scales down with activity levels (below a certain threshold, we go bankrupt).
    - Because taxation is not automatic, puts a lot of work on leadership to keep track of all sites being run and making sure the appropriate payments are being made.
    - When (inevitably) leadership is not present, depends on the goodwill of members to donate the taxed portion to corp (again, bad business sense).
