## Basic Information

To live in an All-Out POS, you must pay rent.

Rent amount is calculated as **All-Out Operating Expenses** divided by **Number of Renters** and sent out as a corp mail around the first of each month.

Renters have until the end of the month to pay.

Assets belonging to members who go inactive or miss payments will be moved out to high sec for retrieval at their leisure.

## Operating Expenses

|           Expense           | Montly Cost |
|:---------------------------:|:-----------:|
|    Tengoo Fun Club [fuel]   |     400m    |
|  Brutor Spiderlings [fuel]  |     200m    |
|   Cuckdari Tengoos [fuel]   |     200m    |
| Deutche Stripperinen [fuel] |     200m    |
|     Vippy [subscription]    |     300m    |
|        Miscellaneous        |     200m    |

Total cost is 1.5b per month.

## Notes

We will be figuring out a system where people who are willing and able to pay more than the required rent can do that and we can track it.

Nootkin has agreed to front 200m of that in order to keep our current staging tower, so only 1.3b is being used to calculate current rent for the moment.

Miscellaneous expenses include but are not limited to:

- Subsidizing hole-rolling ships
- Subsidizing home-defense ships
- Subsidizing cheap roaming ships

## I Can't Afford This

We strongly recommend you join our [planetary interaction program](http://all-out.github.io/guides/planetary-interaction/) - at our usual member activity levels, you should be able to pay your rent with about a quarter of your PI money and it takes less than a week to train. [Relic exploration](http://all-out.github.io/guides/exploration-relic-data/) is also a simple way of making ISK (not to mention finding content in our chains on the side).  Ask in Slack for more ideas if neither of those float your boat.

## What If I Don't Want to Pay Rent?

You can still:

- Be a member of All-Out
- Use the staging POS, meaning you can:
    - Enter the force field
    - Fit ships at the SMA
    - Store ships in the SMA
    - Store items in the CHA
