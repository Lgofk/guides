## Basic Information

To live in an All-Out POS, you must pay rent.

Rent amount is calculated as **All-Out Operating Expenses** divided by **Number of Members Living in All-Out POS** and sent out as a corp mail around the first of each month.

Renters have until the end of the month to pay.

Assets belonging to members who go inactive or miss payments will be moved out to high sec for retrieval at their leisure.

## Operating Expenses

| Name          | Cost/Month |
|---------------|------------|
| Tower 1 fuel  | 400m       |
| Tower 2 fuel  | 400m       |
| Vippy         | 300m       |
| Miscellaneous | 200m       |

This comes to a total operating cost of 1.3b a month.

Miscellaneous expenses include but are not limited to:

- Subsidizing hole-rolling ships
- Subsidizing home-defense ships
- Subsidizing cheap roaming ships

## I Can't Afford This

We strongly recommend you join our [planetary interaction program](http://all-out.github.io/guides/planetary-interaction/) - at our usual member activity levels, you should be able to pay your rent with about a quarter of your PI money and it takes less than a week to train. [Relic exploration](http://all-out.github.io/guides/exploration-relic-data/) is also a simple way of making ISK (not to mention finding content in our chains on the side).  Ask in Slack for more ideas if neither of those float your boat.
