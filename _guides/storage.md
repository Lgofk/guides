## Not In Kansas Any More

There are no stations in wormholes.  We live in POS's instead -
essentially bubbles that only corp members can enter.  You can't dock, but you
can store your mods and ships in certain kinds of anchored containers and refit
ships in space like using a mobile depot.

Certain storage structures are split into divisions for which access can be set
individually. In most cases, everyone assigned to a given division can store
and take items from that division.

All pilots have access to division 1.

All pilots are also assigned a personal division number. Recruits are given
division 2 access when they join, and are promoted to a higher division after a
probationary period.

You can check your division by opening your pilot information window and
checking your titles:

## Storage Structure Specifics

PHA - Personal Hangar Array

: No one - not even directors - can see or touch what you put in here.  It is
totally safe from theft.  *However*, if it is offlined, all items in it are
deleted (like if the corp moves to a different hole while you are inactive, or
the POS is destroyed by enemies.)

CHA - Corp Hangar Array

: Is divided into 7 divisions, each of which has much more space than the PHA
(you can store a few packaged ships inside a division). Directors can use all
divisions (so they can evacuate your stuff in an emergency - or steal it if
they go bad). Everyone has access to Div 1 as well as whatever their assigned
Div is. You are only at risk of theft from people who share your division.


SMA - Ship Maintainence Array

: Can only store ships; has no divisions.  Everyone in the corp can store ships
here, and everyone can eject any ship from here even if they aren't able to fly
it (and bump it out of the bubble lololol).  Most of the "public" ships are
kept here - hole rolling, salvaging, scanning, shuttles, etc.

LSAA - Large Ship Assembly Array

: Is divided into 7 divisions like the CHA, and the same permissions apply. Can
only store ships; you drag them into it from the SMA.  Provides a measure of
security for ship storage; you should probably keep your personal/valuable
ships here.

## First Rule of Eve (Wormhole Corollary)

Whatever you bring into a wormhole is already lost, so make sure you can afford
it.

*But* - if you do wormhole space right, you will get filthy rich.
