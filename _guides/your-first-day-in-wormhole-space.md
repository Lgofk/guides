## General things about Wormhole-Space

- No Stations, we use a POS instead
  - Store your ship in a Ship Maintance Array. Additionaly every member gets a div. Store your ships in the LSAA in your div to make  storing ships safer.
  - Store your loot and stuff in a Personal Hanger Array
  - If you want to go offline, warp to a safe and close the game / logoff. you and your capsule / active ship will be removed from    space

- Wormholes only exist for a limited amount of time. Normally 24h

- Read the info to estimate the remaining life time. If it says that the wormhole is at its end of the lifetime it will collapse in less than 4 hours

- Wormholes do have 2 kinds of mass limits

    1. you can enter some WHs with ships that have a mass less than x kg. you can find a hint in the info of the wormhole. use google to find out what exactly it means for the mass

    2. WHs will collapse after x kg has gone through. again check the info of the wormhole to see if the wormhole max mass is already at critical degree

- Wormhole-Space gets classified in Classes. C1 (easiest) to C6 (hardest). Look up the J-Number at http://wh.pasta.gg/ to get the Class and Statics of a WH

-  Wormhole-Statics: Every WH-Space got atlest 1 Static. For example our new Home got a Highsec-Static. Means that there always will be a Highsec exit.

## Navigation in Wormhole-Space

- DSCAN. FUCKING USE IT

- Don't forget to rename your fucking ship

- make Safe-Spots (warp from a celestial (i.e. a Planet) to another) and open "Save Location" (Ctrl + B) press "Save" to create a Save Mid-Warp.

- use vippy to find the wormhole, to map other wormholes and to find an exit. there is a guide in the corp bulletins (in game)

## Making Money in Wormhole-Space

- Exploration

  - in C1 to C3s you can find pirate Data / Relicsites with good Loot and no rats. while hacking don't forget to HIT FUCKING DSCAN

  - Hint: Datas / Relics called "Unsecured .." are not really unsecured. they have sleepers in it.

- Combat

  - you can do c1 / c2 sites in battlecruisers. I would prefer a drake. You can find a fit in corp fittings.

  - check google bevor entering a site to see the loot and what npcs you will find there

  - for c3s go for a gila or a tengu. fits can be found in corp fittings HIT FUCKING DSCAN WHILE DOING COMBAT SITES carry a mobile depot with warpcore stabs to refit in case you get caught by a ship that is dscan immune
  
  - for good ISK/h and "secure" site running I also recommend RR (Remote Rep) Domis. Can easily do c3s with 2 pilots.

- Mining

  - Ore-Mining: You can find all kinds of Ore there. Just watch out for rats

  - Gas-Huffing: I would prefer it. Pretty good income. Just watch out for rats You only need the Skill "Gas Cloud Harvesting" to level 2. Just buy a Venture and Slap 2 Gas Cloud Harvesters on it and you are good to go.

- PI

  - easy stuff. for the lazy guys, mostly passive income. set up a command center and get ressources even while being offline. haul your shit out and maintain your commmand centers once in a while.
