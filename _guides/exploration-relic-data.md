## Introduction

It's possible for a newbro to make excellent money without risking much if you know what you are doing.  One of the easiest ways I've found is exploration in nullsec and wormhole space.  It's not without some drawbacks - some people find it boring, others find it scary.  Others run into bad RNG and give up before they see good payouts.  All I can say is, I'm very happy with the return I got out of it.  At least the ships used are not expensive and there are no rats to deal with, only players.  And learning to deal with players is really the only tricky part, and applies everywhere else in the game.

## General Tips:

Exploration has very low skill requirements for the amount of ISK return you can expect.  It also teaches you some good habits about navigating in dangerous space:

- You should learn how to make secure safe spot bookmarks out of line of any celestials
- You should always do your scanning while cloaked to avoid getting combat probed
- You should map your directional scanner (dscan) to a hotkey
- In wormholes, you should be refreshing dscan at LEAST twice a minute and preferably every 5 seconds during all the time you are uncloaked
- You should set up a preset for your dscan that displays only ships and force fields so you can easily see if a system is occupied (overview/dscan customization is another topic; google "SaraShawa Overview")

As for how much money you get from exploring, it's hard to pin down because it's very RNG as well as completely dependent on the persistance of the player.  Here are some data points:  I funded 200m seed capital for my market character with it easily, as well as an incursion battleship (~650m).  A few days ago I pulled 120m from a single wormhole site (26 Intact Armor Plates lol).  I know at least one person who has gotten 600m before their character was 7 days old, and at least two people who have PLEX'ed their trial accounts with exploration (in the 1b+ PLEX price days).

## Choosing a Ship:

There are

- Four t1 exploration frigates (one for each race) that you can fly in under a day and fit a basic cloak to in about a week that cost about 2m-4m fully fitted.
- Four covert ops frigates with excellent exploration bonuses and capabilities (one for each race) that take two to three weeks to train and cost about 22m-30m fully fitted (depending on bling).
- A pirate frigate that takes two or three days to fly and a week and a half or so to fit a covert cloak, with better exploration bonuses than the covert ops frigs that costs about 70m-75m fully fitted.

The 8 racial exploration frigates have the same class bonuses and only differ in their slot layouts:

- Caldari t1 **Heron** and t2 **Buzzard** both have the most midslots (five) but the fewest lowslots (two)
- Gallente t1 **Imicus** has a normal four mids, but the t2 **Helios** has five mids like Caldari but has the fewest highslots (two)
- Amarr t1 **Magnate** has the most lowslots (four) but t2 **Anathema** has a normal three like everyone but Caldari
- Minmatar t1 **Probe** and t2 **Cheetah** have a dead average 3 / 4 / 3 slots

If you don't have any race's frigate trained to V yet and are going to be doing a lot of exploring (or scanning in general), I'd recommend using the Caldari **Heron** and later **Buzzard**.  They have extra mids to fit scan bonus mods in order to scan faster.  This also applies to the Gallente t2 **Helios**, but you have to train using the Gallente t1 **Imicus** which doesn't have that mid.

## <a name="space"></a>Pros and Cons of Different Kinds of Space

<a name="hisec"></a>High Security
: The cans are very low value.  The competition to find sites is fierce, because hisec is full of explorers who are afraid to leave it and are fighting to make a living with the available resources.  At least you won't get shot.

<a name="lowsec"></a>Low Security
: The cans are medium value.  The competition is less, but the danger is very high because losec is full of people who are actively looking for kills.  At least you won't have to worry about bubbles so **Warp Core Stabilizers** are a big help.  There will almost always be people in local, which (in known space) is always more dangerous than if there are no people in local.

<a name="nullsec"></a>Null Security
: The cans are great value.  The competition is usually low because nullsec is HUGE, the population is comparatively tiny and most explorers are afraid to go there.  Ironically, it's safer than losec because there are less people around.  You have to watch out for bubbles, though.  Each region in nullsec has a specific pirate faction (you can see that information here: [Dotlan Region Details](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/region)) and all the exploration sites in a given region will belong to that faction.  Sansha sites have the best loot by a significant margin (intact armor plates ftw) but because of this are probably the most dangerous regions for explorers (people know you will be coming and will try to kill you).  Drone regions have no relic sites, only data sites.  More on this later.

<a name="wspace"></a>Wormhole Space
: The cans are the same as nullsec cans (in value).  The competition is the very lowest, because every wormhole has the same chance to be visited (some null areas are easier to get to than others and so sites that spawn in those places are more likely to be taken before you arrive).  The danger is about the same as nullsec; it's harder to see people coming because people don't show up in local until they say something, but the population is even lower than null so you're less likely to run into people.  This might make no sense to you if you've never messed with wormholes, but because of the way wormholes connections work, it's easier to get away because you might have a chain of wormholes already scanned that your pursuer hasn't mapped.  Once you get into that chain, he can't follow you without spending time scanning each signature.  The flip side is you spend MUCH MUCH more time scanning in wormhole space compared to nullsec, because you need to scan every "gate" (wormhole) and because there is a buildup of gas sites everywhere because the population is so low and people who live in wormholes don't often clear gas sites - so you spend a lot of time scanning sigs that turn out to be not things you're interested in. 

## Notes on Navigation:

Nullsec
: Start the [Dotlan Radar Map](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/radar) in the ingame browser and then open the "following map" link out of game.  It'll track where you've been for you, so you can avoid backtracking over the same systems by accident.  Color the map by jumps or kills to find quiet areas to check out.  Keep in mind that dead-end systems are popular ratting systems.  Avoid hacking sites while there are people in local until you have more experience.  One of the big drawbacks of exploring in nullsec is getting  there and back without dying to a camp on the way - you can avoid this by using wormholes.  You can scan a wormhole from hisec and just follow your nose scanning more holes until you find a one that puts you in nullsec somewhere.  Alternatively use [https://www.eve-scout.com/](https://www.eve-scout.com/) to find a connection to Thera near you, go scan it and jump through, and then find a Thera-nullsec connection near where you want to go, and scan it and jump through to it.  It's rare to find a "camped" or a bubbled wormhole (aside from Thera wormholes lol) because holes don't last more than a day.  If you do find people or a bubble on a hole, it's either because they were hunting someone just before you or they know you are coming and are waiting specifically to kill you.  It's not something people do "just because".

Wormhole Space
: If you are solo, use [tripwire.eve-apps.com](tripwire.eve-apps.com) to map your wormhole chains.  It's free.  Make an account (needs an API key with exactly two things checked; no need to worry that it's snooping on you).  Keep the site open and logged in in the ingame browser to map the wormholes you jump through, paste signatures into it as you scan and NEVER FORGET TO BOOKMARK BOTH SIDES OF A WORMHOLE.  There's a bit of a learning curve, but it's well worth it compared to just trying to remember what your chain looks like.  (If you join All-Out, we have a mapping tool with several more features we'll teach you how to use.  It's not recommended here because it's invite-only and not free.)

## Notes on Sites:

Relic Sites
: These usually have payouts in the tens of millions (bad luck is a couple mil, good luck is 20m, really good luck is 50m+) and their loot is very small.  If you only were going to hack one kind of site, most people would choose relics.

Data Sites
: These usually have payouts of around 5m, and their loot is bulkier than relics.  Many people don't bother hacking data sites, and even remove data analyzers from their ships in order to fit more scanning upgrades.  However, data sites can contain BPCs for faction items.  Most are worthless, but some of them are very valuable.  The classic example is the BPC for the True Sansha Control Tower, which people tell me can be sold for a billion ISK.  I've never found a really good blueprint personally, but I think it's worth the shot and I hack all data sites I find.

Wormhole Sites
: - There are *two kinds* of relic and data sites in wormholes: (Important! Newbros keep getting this wrong!)
    - **Pirate sites** contain nothing hostile at all.  Pirate site names always contain the name of one of the New Eden pirate factions (Angel Cartel, Blood Raider, Guristas, Sansha or Serpentis).  A site named "Blood Raider Crystal Quarry" is safe to enter.
    - **Sleeper sites** contain have rats that will instantly destroy an exploration frig.  A site called "Unsecured Frontier Relay" has no pirate name in it, so it's a sleeper site and will kill you (even though it's called "Unsecured").
  - Pirate sites *only spawn* in C1, C2, and C3 class wormholes.  All exploration sites in C4, C5, and C6 holes will be sleeper sites.
    - There is one exception to this!  "Shattered" wormholes can have pirate sites regardless of their class.
  - The sites in wormholes belong to random pirate factions - you are as likely to find a Sansha site as a Serpentis site in a given hole, etc.  This means that your average return from wormholes will be greater than if you were exploring a non-Sansha null region, but less than if you were exploring a Sansha null region.

Rogue Drone Sites
: The drone regions in null have no relic sites at all, and their data sites are the only place where you can get 'Integrated' and 'Augmented' drone BPCs (worth a few mil and 50 to 100 mil, respectively)  Rogue Drone sites don't spawn in wormholes.  The sites are strange, though.  Most of the ones I've found (though I haven't run a lot in drone space) will look like this:  There will be three cans, two thin and one fat.  The two thin cans will be fairly easy to hack, and usually hold drone poop of various kinds and BPCs.  The fat can is usually empty, and is very hard to hack.  If you fail it (can't remember if it's once or twice), two or three drone frigates spawn and attack you.  They are very very weak, though and they don't point you. The drones on a Heron can kill them.  I've heard that successfully hacking the hard can gives a rare chance of getting an escalation (drone data sites are the only relic/data sites that can escalate) but I haven't been able to figure out what the escalation does or how to reliably trigger it.  More research is needed.




## <a name="fitting"></a>Fitting Your Ship

### High Slots:

Core Probe Launcher I
: This takes a set of 8x **Core Scanner Probe I**.  Once you're not losing ships all the time, you might upgrade to using **Sisters Core Scanner Probes**.  Once you're totally comfortable in dangerous space, you might upgrade to a **Sisters Core Probe Launcher**.

Prototype Cloaking Device I
: This is invaluable on a t1 explo frig and should be trained ASAP (though you can explore without it while it's training).  For a covops frig, you need a **Covert Ops Cloaking Device II** (this one is not optional).  While cloaked you can scan if your probes are out, but you can't activate any of your modules (prop mod, hacking mods, *launching* probes, etc.)  You can't warp with an activated t1 cloak, but you can with an activated covops cloak.  Warping cloaked massively cuts down on the risks you need to take.  It's great.

Salvager I
: Most of the exploration frigs have a free high slot that you can do whatever you want with.  I usually put a salvager in it and salvage wrecks I find on gates and elsewhere (this is completely legal as far as CONCORD is concerned).  The other common high slot mods - guns and neuts - are not usually useful to exploration frigs.

### Mid Slots:

5MN Microwarpdrive
: Which one (t1, t2, or any of the meta versions) doesn't matter much.  Pick on based on your skills, available fitting, and cost.  Data sites are 50km across; if you don't have a MWD it means you're vulnerable at the site longer while you burn between cans.

Relic Analyzer I and/or Data Analyzer I
: The t2 versions of these are quite good, but take a bit under a month to train each, so don't worry about them yet.

Cargo Scanner I
: Scan cans before hacking them and paste their contents in [http://evepraisal.com/](http://evepraisal.com/) to see if they're worth hacking.  Personally, I don't hack anything under 500k in value; your rule will depend on how much you need cash.  If you don't want to hack a can, be nice and blow the can up by activating the analyzer on it and closing the window twice.  Leaving any unhacked cans means the site will remain active for a couple of hours after you leave, reduce the chance of more sites spawning, and disappoint other explorers who find it.

If you have any more midslot space, fit any of these: **Scan Acquisition Array I**, **Scan Pinpointing Array I**, or **Scan Rangefinding Array I**.  They will make scanning less painful if you have low skills.  Keep in mind that the **Scan Rangefinding Array** has stacking penalties with the **Gravity Capacitor** rigs discussed in the rigs section.


### Low Slots:

There are three commonly used mods to fill lowslots:

Warp Core Stabilizer I
: These give you +1 warp core strength, of course, but increase the time it takes you to lock things and decrease the distance from which you can lock things.  I DON'T LIKE THESE.  Stabs are most useful in hisec/losec because they only work on targeted points and scrams - they don't work on bubbles, and bubbles aren't allowed in hisec/losec.  But you shouldn't be exploring in hisec/losec because the payout is terrible! You should be in nullsec/wormhole space where the money is good - and in nullsec/wh, bubbles are allowed.

Inertial Stabilizers II
: These make your ship turn and align quite fast (more than nanofibers) - but make your signature bigger (making you easier to lock and shoot).  I THINK THESE ARE OK.  Exploration ships are good at running and bad at fighting.  You should notice when someone is approaching you (with dscan) and enter warp asap, and these help with that. But, unless you can "instawarp" - align in under 2.0 seconds - istabs can bloom your signature a lot.  Asteros can instawarp with enough istabs, and I'm totally down with putting istabs on Asteros.  But i don't think any of the covops ships can, so I don't usually use istabs with them.  (Asteros are excellent exploration ships, but are expensive - and i'm trying to get you to make money using cheap ships).

Nanofiber Internal Structure II
: These make your ship burn, turn, and align all a bit quicker - but weakens your structure HP.  I LIKE THESE.  It's a good tradeoff - you can use them to align and warp fairly fast, but they also help you get around inside a site faster which means you're vulnerable for a shorter time.  If you're taking structure damage in an exploration frigate, you're probably dead already.


### Rig Slots:

Small Gravity Capacitor Upgrade I
:  These reduce the time needed for you to scan a site down.  I usually use two of these.  Turns out this is a better scanning bonus than one of the t2 version of the rig (and there isn't enough calibration to fit two of them)

You might also consider using these:

Small Emission Scope Sharpener I
: These increase the strength of your relic hacking.

Small Memetic Algorithm Bank I
: These increase the strength of your data hacking.

Deciding what combination of rigs you want to use comes down to which you hate more: the time you spend scanning or the feeling of failing a can worth 50m or more.
