  In-depth coverage of how to make money with relic and data sites as a young character.  You don't have to risk much, you learn a lot in the process, and the money is very good compared to most other new-player friendly professions.

It really is possible to make pretty good money without risking too much if you know what you are doing.  One of the easiest ways I've found is exploration in nullsec and wormhole space.  It's not without drawbacks - some people find it boring and/or scary (not sure how both can be true, but lol).  At least the ships used are not expensive and there are no rats to deal with.  Only players :) and learning to do that is really the only kind of tricky part at all.

### Tech 2 Ships

22m-25m Jita prices, you need to train Racial Frigate Level V and Covert Ops Level I

#### Amarr

#### Caldari

#### Gallente

#### Minmatar


## Notes on the ship you use:

If you don't have any race's frigate trained to V yet and are going to be doing a lot of scanning, I'd recommend using the Caldari Heron and Buzzard.  They have the most midslots and so you can fit more scanning mods to scan faster (amarr explo frigs have the most lowslots; min is pretty much the same as gal but has +1 highslot for the covops version)


## Notes on highslots:

- You need a Core Probe Launcher I, which takes a set of 8x Core Scanner Probe I.  Once you're not losing ships all the time, you might upgrade to using Sisters Core Scanner Probes.  Once you're totally comfortable in dangerous space, you might upgrade to a Sisters Core Probe Launcher.  Personally, I will probably never use a sisters launcher; it's just too expensive to be worth it for me.
- For a t1 explo frig, you need a Prototype Cloaking Device I.  For a covops frig, you need a Covert Ops Cloaking Device II.  No exceptions.  While cloaked you can scan but you can't activate any of your modules (prop mod, hacking mods, launching probes, etc.)  You can't warp with a t1 cloak, but you can with a covops cloak.  Warping cloaked massively cuts down on the risks you need to take.  It's great.


## Notes on midslots:

- You need a 5mn microwarpdrive of some kind.  Which one doesn't matter much; pick on based on skills, fitting, and cost.  Data sites are 50km across; if you don't have a MWD it means you're vulnerable at the site longer.
- You need a Relic Analyzer I and a Data Analyzer I.  The t2 versions of these are quite good, but take a bit under a month to train each, so don't worry about them atm.
- You need a Cargo Scanner I.  Scan cans before hacking them and paste their contents in http://evepraisal.com/ to see if they're worth hacking.  Personally, I don't hack anything under 500k in value; your rule will depend on how much you need cash.  If you don't want to hack a can, be nice and blow the can up by activating the analyzer on it and closing the window twice.  Leaving any unhacked cans means the site will remain active for a couple of hours after you leave and disappoint other explorers who find it.
- If you have midslot space, fit any of these: Scan Acquisition Array I, Scan Pinpointing Array I, or Scan Rangefinding Array I.  They will make scanning less painful if you have low skills.  Keep in mind that the Rangefinding Array has stacking penalties with the Gravity Capacitor rigs discussed below.


## Notes on lowslots:

There are three commonly used mods to fill lowslots:
- Warp Core Stabilizer II give you +1 warp core strength, of course, but increase the time it takes you to lock things and decrease the distance from which you can lock things.  I DON'T LIKE THESE.  Stabs are most useful in hisec/losec because they only work on targeted points and scrams - they don't work on bubbles, and bubbles aren't allowed in hisec/losec.  But you shouldn't be exploring in hisec/losec because the payout is terrible! You should be in nullsec/wormhole space where the money is good - and in nullsec/wh, bubbles are allowed.
- Inertial Stabilizers II make your ship turn and align quite fast (more than nanofibers) - but make your signature bigger (making you easier to lock and shoot).  I THINK THESE ARE OK.  Exploration ships are good at running and bad at fighting.  You should notice when someone is approaching you (with dscan) and enter warp asap, and these help with that. But, unless you can "instawarp" - align in under 2.0 seconds - istabs can bloom your signature a lot.  Asteros can instawarp with enough istabs, and I'm totally down with putting istabs on Asteros.  But i don't think any of the covops ships can, so I don't usually use istabs with them.  (Asteros are excellent exploration ships, but are expensive - and i'm trying to get you to make money using cheap ships).
- Nanofiber Internal Structure II make your ship burn, turn, and align a bit quicker - but weakens your structure HP.  I LIKE THESE.  It's a good tradeoff - you can use it to align and warp fairly fast, but it also helps you get around inside a site faster which means you're vulnerable for a shorter time.  If you're into structure in an exploration frig, you're probably dead already.


## Notes on rigs:
- I usually use 2x Small Gravity Capacitor Upgrade I.  Turns out this is a better scanning bonus than 1x the t2 version of the rig.
- You might also consider using Small Emission Scope Sharpener I (easier relic hacking) or Small Memetic Algorithm Bank I (easier data hacking).
Deciding which combination of rigs you want to use basically comes down to which you hate more: the time you spend scanning or the feeling of failing a can worth 50m.

## Notes on space:

Hisec
: The cans are very low value and the competition to find sites is fierce, because hisec is full of explorers who are afraid to leave it and are fighting to make a living with the available resources.  At least you won't get shot.

Losec
: The cans are medium value.  The competition is less, but the danger is very high because losec is full of people who are actively looking for kills.  At least you won't have to worry about bubbles so warp core stabs could help you, but there will almost always be people in local so it'll be hard to judge if you're in danger or not.

Nullsec
: The cans are great value.  The competition is low because nullsec is HUGE, the population is tiny (not just relative to the number of systems but actually objectively less people live there than hisec) and most explorers are afraid to go there.  The danger is ironically lower than in losec, because there are less people around.  You can   There are bubbles, though.  Each region in nullsec has a specific pirate faction (you can look this up on DotLan) and all the exploration sites in that region will belong to that faction.  Sansha sites have the best loot by a significant margin (intact armor plates ftw).  Drone regions have no relic sites, only data sites.  More on this later.

Wormholes
: The cans are the same as nullsec cans (in value).  The competition is the very lowest, because every wormhole has the same chance to be visited (some null areas are easier to get to than others and so sites that spawn there are more likely to be taken before you arrive).  The danger is about the same as nullsec; it's harder to see people coming because no local chat, but the population is even lower than null so you're less likely to run into people.  This might make no sense to you if you've never messed with wormholes, but because of the way wormholes connections work, it's easier to get away because you might have a chain of wormholes already scanned that your pursuer hasn't mapped.  Once you get into that chain, he can't follow you without spending time scanning each signature.  The flip side is you spend MUCH MUCH more time scanning in wormhole space compared to nullsec, because you need to scan every "gate" (wormhole) and because there is a buildup of gas sites everywhere because the population is so low and people who live in wormholes don't often clear gas sites - so you spend a lot of time scanning sigs that turn out to be not things you're interested in. 

## Notes on navigation:

Nullsec
: http://evemaps.dotlan.net/radar.  Start this in the ingame browser and then open the following map link out of game.  It'll track where you've been so you don't backtrack over the same systems by accident.  Color the map by jumps and kills to find quiet areas to check.  Keep in mind that dead-end systems are often people's homes.  Avoid hacking sites while there are people in local until you have more experience.  One of the big drawbacks of exploring in nullsec is just getting out there and back without dying to a camp on the way - you can avoid this by using wormholes.  You can scan a wormhole from hisec and just follow your nose scanning more holes until you find a one that puts you in nullsec somewhere.  Alternatively use https://www.eve-scout.com/ to find a connection to Thera near you, go scan it and jump through, and then find a Thera-nullsec connection near where you want to go, and scan it and jump through to it.  It's much rarer to find a "camped" or a bubbled wormhole because they don't last more than a day.  If you do find people or a bubble on a hole, it's either because they were hunting someone just before you or they are there specifically to kill you.  It's not something people do "just because".

Wormhole Space
: tripwire.eve-apps.com.  It's free.  Make an account (needs an API key with exactly two things checked; no need to worry that it's snooping on you).  Keep the site open and logged in in the ingame browser to map the wormholes you jump through, paste signatures into it as you scan and NEVER FORGET TO BOOKMARK BOTH SIDES OF A WORMHOLE.

## Notes on (null/wh) sites:

- Relic sites usually have payouts in the tens of millions (bad luck is a couple mil, good luck is 20m, really good luck is 50m+) and their loot is very small.  If you only were going to hack one kind of site, most people would choose relics.
- Data sites usually have payouts of around 5m, and their loot is bulkier than relics.  Many people don't bother hacking data sites, and even remove data analyzers from their ships in order to fit more scanning upgrades.  However, data sites can contain BPCs for faction items.  Most are worthless, but some of them are very valuable.  The classic example is the BPC for the True Sansha Control Tower, which people tell me can be sold for a billion ISK.  I've never found a really good blueprint personally, but I think it's worth the shot and I hack all data sites I find.
- Wormholes have two kinds of relic and data sites: sleeper sites (which have rats that will step on an exploration frig without noticing) and pirate sites (which have no rats at all).  Pirate site names always contain the name of one of the New Eden pirate factions (sansha, gurista, blood angel, etc).  A site called, for example, "Unsecured Frontier Relay" has no pirate name in it, so it's a sleeper site and has rats (even though it's called "Unsecured").  Pirate sites will only spawn in C1, C2, and C3 holes.  All exploration sites in C4, C5, and C6 holes will be sleeper sites.  The exception is in "shattered" wormholes, which can have pirate sites regardless of class. Also, the sites in wormholes belong to random factions - you are as likely to find a sansha site as a serpentis site in a given hole, etc.

| Eve Online Pirate Factions |

- Rogue Drone regions in null have no relic sites at all, and their data sites are the only place in New Eden where you can get Integrated (sometimes worth a few mil) and Augmented (usually worth a good 50m or more) drone BPCs (drone data sites don't spawn in wormholes).  The sites are strange, though.  Most of the ones I've found (though I haven't run a lot in drone space) will look like this:  There will be three cans, two thin and one fat.  The two thin cans will be fairly easy to hack, and usually hold drone poop of various kinds and BPCs.  The fat can is usually empty, and is very hard to hack.  If you fail it (can't remember if it's once or twice), two or three drone frigates spawn and attack you.  They are very very weak, though and they don't point you. The drones on a Heron can kill them.  I've heard that successfully hacking the hard can gives a rare chance of getting an escalation (drone data sites are the only relic/data sites that can escalate) but I haven't been able to figure out what the escalation does or how to reliably trigger it.  More research is needed.

## Notes on exploration as a profession:

Exploration has very low skill requirements for the amount of isk return you can expect.  It also teaches you some good habits about navigating in dangerous space.  You should learn how to make secure safe spots.  You should always do your scanning while cloaked to avoid getting combat probed.  In wormholes, you should be clicking dscan twice a minute at least all the time you are uncloaked, and you should have a preset for your dscan that displays only ships and force-fields so you can easily see if a system is occupied.  As for how much money you get from it, I funded 200m seed capital for my market character with it easily, as well as my first incursion battleship (~650m).  A few days ago I pulled 120m from four cans in a wormhole (26 Intact Armor Plates lol).
