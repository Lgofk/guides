## Formatting

### File

Guides are plain-text files with the extension `.md` (for Markdown).  The URL
of the page comes from the filename - for example, this page's file is named
`writing-guides.md` and its URL is at `/guides/writing-guides/`.

### Content

Most of the content in a guide is written in a variant of Markdown (similar to
Slack Post formatting).

- [kramdown
quick- ref](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html): List of syntax you can use
- [sourcefile of this page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/all-out/guides/master/_guides/bookmarks.markdown): sourcefile of this page, for reference

The first section of every guide is called the "front matter" and is enclosed by two `---` lines.  This is *not* Markdown, but is used for defining metadata about the guide.

#### Notes on Content:

Please don't use level 1 headers (using `=======` or `#`)
